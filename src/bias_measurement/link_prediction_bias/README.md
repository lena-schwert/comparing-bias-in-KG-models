This folder contains code adapted from https://github.com/mianzg/kgbiasdetec/ which belongs to the paper:

Keidar, D., Zhong, M., Zhang, C., Shrestha, Y. R., & Paudel, B. (2021). Towards Automatic Bias Detection in Knowledge Graphs. Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2021, 3804â€“3811.

From their code, I use only the bias measurement part, as I train embeddings 

Basically all the code based on the `trained_model.pkl` and then the `preds_df`
is of interest to me.
