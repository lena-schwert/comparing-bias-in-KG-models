## A Comparative Bias Analysis Study In Link Prediction Models

## Structure of this project

The `src` folder contains all python files and command line scripts.

The processed data files used for training all models are contained in the folder `data/processed`.




## Setting file paths

All scripts are using the function `set_base_path_based_on_host()` in
`utils.py` to set the **base path for saving and loading files**.

Make sure that you adapt the path in this function to your project.
